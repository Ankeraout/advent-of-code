This one needs to be solved manually for step #2:
    - The weights for the first 200 iterations will be printed
    - Notice that there is a loop
    - Get the starting index of the first iteration in the loop, i
    - Compute the size of the loop, m
    - n = 10^9 % m
    - p = i % m
    - r = i + m + n - p

I am aware that this can be solved by using a cycle detection algorithm, but I
am too lazy to implement it. :)
